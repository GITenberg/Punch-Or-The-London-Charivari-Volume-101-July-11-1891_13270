    <h3>MORE <i>POT-POURRI</i> FROM THE PARK.</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>The Park, near Cumberland Gate, on almost
        any fine afternoon. Behind the rails separating the turf
        from the paths, Orators, Preachers, and Reciters are
        holding forth, for the delectation of small groups, who are
        mostly engaged in discussing some totally different
        subject. A set debate, with a time-limit, and a purely
        ornamental Chairman, is in progress between a Parnellite
        and an Anti-Parnellite. The reader will kindly imagine
        himself to be passing slowly along the line.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>A Youthful Socialist</i> (<i>haranguing the usual crowd
    of well-to-do loungers, and working himself up to the requisite
    white-heat of factitious fury</i>). And what are these
    Capitalists? I'll tell yer. Jest a lot o' greedy gobblers and
    profit-mongering sharks, as eat up the smaller fry. And what
    are <i>you</i>? Why, you're the small fish as eat mud&mdash;and
    let yourselves <i>be</i> gobbled! (<i>The crowd accept this
    definition of themselves with perfect gaiety and
    good-humour.</i>) Some will tell yer that these lazy, idle
    loafers, work as hard as what we do ourselves. (<i>Derisive
    laughter at this ridiculous idea.</i>) Mind yer, I'm not saying
    they don't. <i>Honly</i>, the 'arder they work, the worse it is
    for us; because the more they work the more they <i>rob</i>!
    That's what they send their sons to Oxford and to
    Cambridge&mdash;as was built and endowed for the benefit of us,
    the labourin' classes&mdash;for. They send 'em there to learn
    <i>'ow to rob</i>!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Here a discussion breaks out between a</i> Sceptic
        <i>and a</i> Spiritualist, <i>who, with half-a-dozen
        interested auditors, have been putting their heads together
        in a corner.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>The Sceptic</i>. No,&mdash;but keep to the
    point,&mdash;you're shufflin' the question. I want to argue
    this out on logical grounds. I know as well as <i>you</i> do
    that, if only I 'ave 'armony and a round table in my family, I
    can make that table dance the poker&mdash;but what I'm puttin'
    to <i>you</i> is (<i>triumphantly</i>), 'ow does that prove to
    me as I'm in communication with the Bogie Man? That's what
    <i>you've</i> got to answer.</p>

    <p><i>The Y.S.</i>. We Soshalists 'ate the Tories as we 'ate
    sin. Why, young polertician as I ham, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

    <p><i>The Spiritualist</i> (<i>an elderly and earnest
    person</i>). All I can reply to you is, we Spiritualists do not
    think&mdash;we <i>know</i> that these phenomena
    appear&mdash;yes, as surely as I know I am 'olding this stick
    in my 'and.</p>

    <p><i>The Sceptic</i> (<i>pityingly</i>). There you go again,
    yer see&mdash;that stick ain't the point. <i>I</i> can see the
    stick. A stick ain't a phenomena&mdash;you're confusin' two
    different things. Now I'm goin' to offer you a fair challenge.
    You perdooce me a Spirit&mdash;not in a back room, with the
    lights out, but <i>'ere</i>, in broad daylight, in this
    Park&mdash;you get that Spirit to naturalise itself, or
    whatever you call it, and I'll <i>believe</i> in 'im. Come,
    now!</p>

    <p><i>A Bystander</i>. Ah, that's the way to corner <i>'is</i>
    sort. 'E knows 'e carn't <i>do</i> it!</p>

    <p><i>The Spiritualist</i> (<i>with a smile of sad
    superiority</i>). Ridicule ain't argyment.</p>

    <p><i>The Young Socialist</i>. Don't tork to me of Patriotism!
    What have the likes of you and me got to be patriotic about?
    I'm a Universalist, I am, and so long as a man rallies round
    our glorious Red Flag (<i>here he waves a dingy scarlet rag on
    a stick</i>), it's all one to me whether his own colour is
    black, yeller, green, brown, <i>or</i> white!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Applause.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Reciter Number One</i> (<i>in the midst of a thrilling
    prose narrative about a certain</i> "'ARRY," <i>who has
    apparently got into legal difficulties for having thrown a
    cocoa-nut stick at a retired Colonel</i>). Well, I went into
    the Court 'ouse, and there, sure enough, was my pore mate 'ARRY
    in the dock, and there was hold Ginger-whiskers
    (<i>laughter</i>) a setting on the bench along with the hother
    beaks, lookin' biliouser, and pepperier, and more
    happerplecticker nor ever! "Prison-ar," he sez, addressin'
    'ARRY (<i>imitation of the voice and manner of a retired
    Colonel</i>), "Prison-ar, 'ave you&mdash;har&mdash;hanythink to
    say in your beyarf&mdash;har?" And then, hall of a sudden, I
    sor a flash come into my dear 'ole comride 'ARRY's heyes, as he
    strightened 'imself in the dock, and gave the milingtery sloot,
    and then, in a voice as sounded as true and sweet and clear as
    a bell, he sez&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>A Dingy and Unprepossessing Preacher</i>
    (<i>unctuously</i>). Well beloved friends, as I was telling
    yer, I went 'ome to the 'ouse of that pious Methodist lady, and
    she told me as 'ow she 'ad two dear unconverted sons, an' I
    knelt down (<i>&amp;c., &amp;c.</i>), an' after that we 'ad our
    tea, and then I preached a sermon&mdash;ah, I well remember I
    took my tex from (<i>&amp;c. &amp;c.</i>)&mdash;an' then she
    gave me supper (<i>more unctuously still</i>), as nice a bit o'
    cold beef and 'ome-brewed ale as ever I wish to taste, and I
    slep' that blessed night in a warm comfortable bed&mdash;and
    this (<i>drawing the inevitable moral</i>) this brings me round
    to what I started on, inasmuch as it proves (<i>with a
    forbidding smile</i>) as 'ow yer may sometimes hentertain a
    angel unawares!</p>

    <p><i>Reciter Number Two</i> (<i>giving his own private version
    of "The Ticket of Leave Man."</i>) Fourpence 'ap'ny, Gentlemen,
    is <i>not</i> a very 'arty nor corjial recognition of my
    talent; <i>'owever</i>, I will now perceed with the Drarmer.
    The Curtain rises upon the Second Hact. Hover three years 'ave
    elapsed since <i>Robert Brierley</i>&mdash;(&amp;c.) We are in
    <i>May Hedwardses</i> lodgings. She is torkin to 'er goldfinch.
    If you boys don't give over larkin' and stand back, you'll get
    a cuff on some of your 'eds. "Goldie," she sez, "I've 'ad a
    letter from <i>'Im</i> this morning!" And the bird puts his
    little 'ed a one side, and a'most seems as if he compre'ended
    'er meanin'! <i>Mrs. Willoughby</i> is 'eard outside sayin',
    "May I come in?" I will now hendeavour to give you a imitation
    of <i>Mrs. Willoughby</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Anti-Parnellite Irishman</i> (<i>warmly</i>). Is it kape
    to the point? Oi till that white-feeced an' black-hearrted
    loiar, TIM MURPHY, that if he interrups me wance more whoile

    <p>A REAL TREAT.&mdash;<i>Advice to
    Covent-gardeners</i>.&mdash;If <i>Carmen</i> is to be done
    again this season with the same cast as it had on Saturday
    last, no one who cares for an exceptionally first-rate
    performance should miss this opera-tunity. There is no better
    representative of <i>Carmen</i> than Mlle. ZELIE DE
    LUSSAN,&mdash;how can there be, since the Spanish Gipsy heroine
    of the plot is herself a <i>Loose 'un</i>? Madame MELBA was
    charming as <i>Mickie Ella</i>, the Irish girl in Spain. M.
    LASSALLE appeared as <i>Escamillo</i>. the bull-fighter, in a
    novel, and doubtless a correct, costume, and his great
    <i>Toréador</i> song was vociferously encored. Then, finally,
    JEAN DE RESKÉ, who made of the usually idiotic <i>Don José</i>
    a fine acting as well as a fine singing part. It drew a big
    house, and would have been a pretty dish to set before an
    Emperor on Wednesday, if, on that occasion, the Opera itself
    were the only consideration.</p>

    <h4><i>The Magnum Opus.</i></h4>

        <a href="images/15-1.png"><img width="100%"

    <p><i>À propos</i> of this heading, what a treasure a <i>Magnum
    Opal</i> would be. This remark is only "by the way." My motto
    is Business First, Play (on words) afterwards. So to work.</p>

    <p>I really think I shall take to Guide-book writing.
    <i>Grandolph's Guides</i> would be immensely popular. I'm sure
    I can do it&mdash;for upon my word I can do a'most anything if
    I only buckle to. By the way, '<i>Buckle</i>' suggests history.
    Can go in for "making history" when I've done this work.
    WILLIAMS&mdash;not MONTAGU the Magistrate&mdash;(good title
    this for something)&mdash;but my friend the Companionable
    Captain &mdash;&mdash; is at work; when he has done, he reads
    out a few descriptive paragraphs for my approbation, or the
    contrary. When I nod it means that I like it; when I don't nod,
    he has to wait till I do. I generally begin nodding about the
    middle of the first paragraph.</p>

    <p>"Well," says he, the other day, quite suddenly, "I'm glad
    you like it all so much."</p>

    <p>"Like all what?" I exclaimed, blowing the cigar-ash off my
    pyjamas, and wondering to myself how I could have been so
    absorbed in his reading aloud as to have let my half-smoked
    havannah tumble on to the floor.</p>

    <p>"Why, all I've been reading to you for the last hour and a
    half," returned the Captain, apparently somewhat annoyed;
    peppery chap, the Captain,&mdash;'Curried' Captain when on
    board Sir DONALD's boat,&mdash;but to resume. Says the Curried
    Captain, still a bit annoyed, "You passed all the paragraphs,
    one after the other, and whenever I stopped to ask you how you
    liked it, you nodded."</p>

    <p>I didn't like to hurt the gallant scribe's feelings, but the
    fact is that he, as a reader, has a very soothing-syrupy tone
    and, I fancy, that in less than a quarter of an hour, judging
    by the moiety of my cigar. I must have fallen fast asleep.</p>

    <p>"That's posted, is it?" I ask, evading further explanation.
    "It is," he answers. "But I've got another lot&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Good!" I interrupt him, rather abruptly I own, but, from
    experience I say it, if I don't take myself when in the
    humour&mdash;'on the hop,' so to speak, as they said of the
    <i>scarabæus</i> in Kent&mdash;(trust <i>me</i> for natural
    history and plenty of it)&mdash;I'm no use at all. Now at this
    moment I am wide awake, a giant refreshed; so I light another
    fragrant weed, and call for another cool drink, as I haven't
    the smallest idea what became of the one I ordered when the
    Gallant Graphist commenced reading; I rather suspect he 'put it
    to his lips when so dispoged,' and that, in this instance also,
    he mistook my nod for silent but emphatic encouragement.</p>

    <p>"Now," I say to the Amiable Amanuensis and Adaptable Author,
    "you read your stuff aloud with emphasis and discretion, and
    I'll chuck in the ornamental part. Excuse me, that's <i>my</i>
    drink," I say, with an emphasis on the possessive pronoun, for
    the Soldierly Scribe, in a moment of absorption, was about to
    apply that process to my liquor. He apologises handsomely, and
    commences his recital. In the absence of a gong,&mdash;one
    ought never to travel without a gong,&mdash;I whack the
    tea-tray with a paper-knife. "All in to begin!"</p>

    <p>"<i>The mail train</i>," &amp;c., &amp;c. I make my notes,
    and remark that MURRAY and BRADSHAW lost a great chance in not
    having long ago secured the services of the Corresponding
    Captain. "<i>The railroad passes through mountain scenery of
    exceptional</i>," &amp;c., &amp;c. BRADSHAW and MURRAY, not to
    mention BAEDEKER and BLACK, absolutely not in it with the
    Wandering Warrior. "<i>About thirty miles from Cape
    Town</i>"&mdash;</p>

    <h4>A SIMPLE SUGGESTION.</h4>

    <p>I stop him at this point. "Couldn't we have a song
    here?"</p>

    <p>"Why?" asks the Simple Soldier, glaring at me, and pulling
    his moustache.</p>

    <p>"Just to lighten it up a bit," I explain. "You see 'About
    thirty miles' and so forth, suggests the old song of <i>Within
    a Mile of Edinboro' Town</i>."</p>

    <p>"Don't see it," says the Virtuous Veteran, stolidly.</p>

    <p>"Well, I'll make a note of it," and I add pleasantly, as is
    my way, "if it's a song, I'll make <i>several notes</i> of
    it."</p>

    <p>"Um!" growls the Severe Soldier, and once again I defeat him
    in an attempt at surprising my outpost, <i>i.e.</i>, my tumbler
    of cool drink. He apologises gruffly but politely, and then
    continues his reading.</p>

    <h4>ON WE GOES AGAIN.</h4>

    <p>He continues to read about "<i>distances," "so many feet
    above sea-levels," "engineering skill</i>," &amp;c., &amp;c.,
    which I observe to him will all make capital padding for a
    guide-book, when I am suddenly struck by the sound of the word
    I had just used, <i>viz.</i>, 'padding.'</p>

    <h4>PADDINGTON.</h4>

    <p>"By Jove!" I exclaim.</p>

    <p>"What is it?" asks the Confused Captain, looking up from his
    MS.</p>

    <p>"'Padding,'" I reply&mdash;"Only add a 'ton' to it, and that
    will give it just the weight I require. Don't you see?" I ask
    him, impetuously. But he merely shakes his head, and lugs at
    his moustache. I explain the idea, as if it were a charade. I
    say, "The whole notion is 'padding&mdash;ton.' See?"</p>

    <p>The Ruminating Reader thinks it won't do. "Yes it will," I
    urge&mdash;"it will lighten it up. Who wants statistics without
    anecdote? Now for an anecdote; and I knock one off, <i>sur le
    champ</i>, about the engine-driver, the stoker, and several
    other persons, all on the look-out for promotion, informing me
    of their being <i>Paddington men of considerable political
    influence at home</i>. The Cautious Captain accepts the
    anecdote, interpolates it, and after I have called for and
    imbibed another tumbler of 'my own partik,' and lighted another
    cigar, the Conscientious Captain resumes his
    entertainment."</p>

    <h4>NO PIANO.</h4>

    <p>He reads on. Another drink, just to rivet my attention. Will
    he take something? No? Then <i>I</i> will. His health, and
    song&mdash;I mean 'treatise,' or whatever he calls it&mdash;say
    'lecture.' Wish we'd had a piano. Never will travel without one
    again. <i>Mem.</i>&mdash;Gong and piano. I don't pretend to be
    a thorough musician, but as a one-fingered player I'd give Sir
    CHARLES HALLÉ odds and beat him. Now then&mdash;let's see where
    were we. Another tumbler iced. Good. <i>Allez!</i> Captain, go
    ahead!</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:20%;">
        <a href="images/15-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/15-2.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Somehow or another, after this&mdash;that is, I can only
    time it by the fact of my having called for a fourth or fifth
    glass of iced drink, or it may have been my half-dozenth, for
    time does fly so,&mdash;the Captain having, I suspect, drank
    the greater part of the previous one whenever I didn't happen
    to be looking that way&mdash;I begin to think I must have once
    more given my assent by nodding to a lot of stuff of which I
    could not nave heard more than three pages, as, when I arouse
    myself from my reverie, the tumbler is empty, the Captain has
    gone out, and so has my cigar.</p>

    <h4>AWAY! AWAY!</h4>

    <p>"Action is the word!" said I, suddenly jumping up; and,
    having seized a spade, and provided myself with a large sack,
    which I carried across my shoulders, I set off for the
    diamond-fields. Unrecognised by a soul, I went to work on my
    own account; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"
       id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span> and the brilliant things I
       saw&mdash;far more brilliant than even the witticisms of
       WOLFFY, or the sarcasms of ARTHUR B! Into my sack go
       thousands of diamonds! The sack is full! <i>Aladdin</i> and
       the Lamp not in it with me! "Hallo!" shouts a voice,
       gruffly. I could see no one. "<i>Vox et præterea nil</i>,"
       as we used to say at Eton. Suddenly I felt myself collared.
       I made a gallant attempt at resistance. A spade is a spade I
       know, but what is a spade and one against twenty with
       pistols and daggers, headed by the redoubtable
       Filliblusterer THOMAS TIDDLER himself? "Strip him!" said
       T.T., shortly.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/16-1.png"><img width="100%"

    </div>

    <p>Will you believe that the only way in which in this country
    they arrive at implicitly believing every word you utter, is by
    denuding you of all your clothes, so as to get at the naked
    truth, holding you up by the heels for the purpose of shaking
    the diamonds out of you, in case any are concealed in your
    hair, mouth, ears, eyes and so forth.</p>

    <p>"He has diamonds on the brain!" I hear some ruffian exclaim,
    and in another second&mdash;</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Well&mdash;what happened I cannot tell you: I must have
    fainted. When I came to myself I was lying by the chair in
    which I had been previously sitting when listening to the
    Captain's reading, and bending over me with a glass of water in
    his hand, was the faithful and clever Doctor whose
    companionship on this voyage of discovery I am daily and hourly
    learning to appreciate at its proper value. I fancy the ship's
    crew were round about me, with the Engineer and the Chaplain. I
    feel inclined to say, "HARDY, HARDY, kiss me, HARDY!" and then
    something about "Tell them at home"&mdash;but the words stick
    in my throat, as they did in <i>Macbeth's</i> throat (only they
    were other words) when he was on his throat-sticking
    expedition. (Little Shakspearian reference thrown in here, and
    no extra charge.)</p>

    <p>"How many of these has he had?" I hear the Doctor say, and I
    perceived that he was holding up an empty tumbler. I should
    like to explain that, as we were engaged in composition, there
    had been 'composing draughts.' I fancy I caught the tone of the
    Clever Captain's voice in reply, but the next minute I felt
    myself being lifted up and carried off. I wished to tell them
    of my strange adventure, and how I had barely escaped with my
    life, but somehow drowsiness overcame me, and I must have
    fallen asleep.</p>

    <h4>BUSINESS AS BEFORE.</h4>

    <p>To-day I sit down to write out this strange story. Once I
    asked the Cautious Captain and the Doubting Doctor "if they had
    seen anything of my pickaxe and the sack of diamonds." But they
    only smiled at one another, elevated their eyebrows, then
    winked, and laughed.</p>

    <p>What is their little game?</p>

    <p>No matter. I will lie low. My motto is "Diamonds are
    trumps." I'm not here as <i>Aladdin</i> for nothing. "Aha!" as
    the old melodramatic villain used to say, "a time will come! No
    mattar!"</p>

    <h4>RATHER CURRIE-OUS!</h4>

    <p>I don't know whether it is owing to my voyage in a DONALD
    CURRIE steamer&mdash;'twas the first opportunity that ever I
    had of tasting a DONALD CURRIE, and excellent it is, as of
    course, was all our "board" on board&mdash;(send this joke to
    WOLFFY&mdash;he'll work it up and make a real <i>impromptu</i>
    sparkler of it&mdash;and I don't grudge him the <i>kudos</i> of
    it, not one little bit)&mdash;or to the change of air, but I am
    bound to say openly that I do think the G.O.M. has been right
    about most things, especially about Majuba (who was <i>Pa</i>
    JUBA? Send this to DRUMMY WOLFFY), and&mdash;well, I shall have
    more to say on this subject. If this meets the eye of any
    friendly person, will he kindly remember me to my Uncle?
    Thanks. That's the ticket. More anon.

    <h2>ROBERT ON THE HEMPERER'S WISIT TO THE CITY.</h2>

    <p>The pore owerworked Committee has gone and got thereselves
    into a nice mess, and all by their kindness in wanting to let
    as many people as possibel see the grate show on Friday. They
    has acshally bin and ordered a grate bilding with rows of
    seats, out in Gildhall Yard, enuff to hold about a thousand
    Ladies and Gentlemen, all in their best close, with capital
    views of ewerybody and ewerythink, and now they are told that
    it won't be posserbel not to give em nothing to heat or to
    drink, tho' they must set there quite quiet for at least three
    hours! I wunder what they will all think of Copperashun
    Horspitality after that!</p>

    <p>I'm told as one werry respectable but ancient Deputy
    acshally surgested, that after the Hemperer and Hempress and
    their sweet had all gone home, all the whole thousand starving
    wisitors should be turned into Gildhall and allowed to eat and
    drink all the fragments as was left. Yes, Mr. Deputy, all wery
    kind and thortful of you as regards the harf-starved wisitors,
    but how about us Waiters? You, with all your experience,
    ewidentally don't know the wally of what such eminent Swells as
    Hemperers and Hempresses leaves on their plates, and the
    skrambel for 'em drectly as they leaves. Why, I have acshally
    seen with my own estonished eyes, a lady, after enquiring of me
    which chair a sutten elustreous person had set in, stoop down
    and kiss its harm, wich was nex to kissin <i>his</i> hand, and
    then give harf-a-crown for harf a happel as was left on the
    plate! Ah, that's what I calls true loyalty, and werry much it
    is admired by all of us.</p>

    <p>I hunderstands as the Government, wanting to estonish the
    Hemperer, has lent the City a reglar army of troops to stand on
    both sides of the Streets from Buckinham Pallis all the way to
    Gildhall. And in case the estonishing site shood make him feel
    just a leetle dazed, the jolly old Copperashun has bin and gone
    and hired no less than three Millingterry Bands of Music to
    play to him, and cheer him up.</p>

    <p>There was a talk of engaging all the many German Bands, as
    makes our streets so musical, to give the Hemperer a serrynade
    at Lunch; but Mr. WEST HILL, of the Gildhall Skool of Music,
    thort it might be too much for His Madjesty's feelinx, so the
    highdear was given up. I werily bleeves that of all the many
    anxious buzzoms as is a beating with suppressed emotion for
    next Friday, the carmest and the all serenest of the lot is
    that of ROBERT.</p>

    <p>LIBERTY AND LICENCE.&mdash;It is said that <i>The Maske of
    Flowers</i> would never have drawn gold on Monday last to the
    coffers of that excellent charity, the Convalescent Home at
    Westgate-on-Sea had not one of the Prominent Performers
    consented to become the responsible and actual Manager of the
    "Theatre Royal, Inner Temple." By the terms of his licence he
    was bound, amongst other things, to see that no smoking was
    permitted in the auditorium, no exhibition of wild beasts was
    allowed on the premises, and no hanging took place from the
    flies. It is satisfactory to learn (that, in spite of many
    Benchers being present) none of these wholesome regulations
    were infringed. It is true that the Music of the <i>Maske</i>
    was duly executed, but then this painful operation was
    conducted (by Mr. PRENDERGAST) from the floor of the building,
    and not from its roof. Thus the orders of the LORD CHAMBERLAIN
    were strictly observed by a Barrister, who can now claim to
    have been Manager of a genuine Temple of the Drama.</p>

    <p>A REMINDER.&mdash;Mr. EDMUND B.V. CHRISTIAN, in <i>Baily's
    Magazine</i>, quoted by the <i>P.M.G.</i> last Thursday,
    complains "that cricket, the most popular of games, fills so
    small a space in literature." Does he forget that CHARLES
    DICKENS devoted one entire Christmas Book to <i>The Cricket on

    <h2>LETTERS TO ABSTRACTIONS.</h2>

    <h3>No. I.&mdash;TO SOCIAL AMBITION.</h3>

    <p>DEAR SIR, OR MADAM,</p>

    <p>I trust you will observe and appreciate the discreet
    ambiguity of style with which I have chosen to address you. I
    may assure you at once that I have done this not without
    considerable thought. For, though I have often watched you in
    the exercise of your energies, I have never yet been able to
    satisfy myself as to whether I ought to class you amongst our
    rougher sex, or include you in the ranks of those who wear high
    heels, and very low dresses. Sometimes you fix your place of
    business in a breast adequately covered by a stiff and shining
    shirt-front and a well-cut waistcoat. Sometimes you inhabit the
    expansive bosom of a matron. Nor do you confine yourself to one
    class alone out of the many that go to the composition of our
    social life. You have impelled grocers to ludicrous pitches of
    absurdity; you have driven the wife of a working-man to
    distraction because her neighbour's front room possesses a more
    expensive carpet, of a sprucer pattern than her own. Clerks
    have suffered acutely from your stings, and actresses have
    spent many a sleepless night under your malign influence. You
    have tortured Dukes on the peaks of gracious splendour where
    they sit enthroned as far above common mortals as they ought to
    be above the common feeling of envy; and you have caused even
    Queens to writhe because there happened to be a few stray
    Empresses in the world.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:40%;">
        <a href="images/17.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/17.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>On the whole, then, I think I do wisely in leaving the
    question of your sex a doubtful one. You would wish it so left
    yourself, otherwise so powerful a personality as yours would, I
    am certain, have revealed itself with greater clearness to an
    honest investigator, such as I humbly trust I have proved
    myself. But, be that as it may, I can assert with perfect
    confidence that you are no respecter of persons, though it
    must, in fairness, be added, that one of your chief functions
    seems to be to implant an exaggerated respect and admiration of
    others in the minds of your victims. In saying this I praise
    your impartiality, while I hint a dislike of your ordinary
    methods. Not that I have any hope of causing you to desist. For
    to desist would be to cease to exist, and I cannot fairly
    expect you to commit suicide, however much I may desire it.
    Moreover, your subjects&mdash;for, to be candid, you are a
    despot&mdash;seem to like you. You minister so craftily to
    their self-esteem, you flatter their vanity with an adroitness
    so remarkable, that, after a few feeble struggles, they resign
    themselves, body and soul, to your thrall. Even then you
    proceed warily. Your first labour is to collect, with patient
    care, all the little elements of dissatisfaction that are
    latent in every nature, and to blend them with the petty
    disappointments to which even the best of us are liable. The
    material thus obtained you temper with intentions that seem to
    be good, and eventually you forge out of it a weapon of
    marvellous point and sharpness, with which you mercilessly goad
    your victims along the path that leads to ridicule and
    disaster.</p>

    <p>Let me take an instance which I am sure you will remember.
    When I first met little DABCHICK, I thought I had never seen a
    happier mortal. He was clever, good-natured, and sprightly. He
    sold tea somewhere in Mincing Lane, and on the proceeds of his
    sales he managed to support a wife and two pleasant children in
    reasonable comfort at Balham. Mrs. DABCHICK could not be
    accused by her best friends of over-refinement, but everybody
    agreed that she was just the homely, comfortable, housewifely
    person who would always make DABCHICK happy, and be a good and
    careful mother to his children. Often in the old days when I
    came down to Balham and took pot-luck with DABCHICK, while Mrs.
    DABCHICK beamed serenity and middle-class satisfaction upon me
    from the other end of the table, and the juvenile JOHNNY
    DABCHICK recited in a piping treble one of Mr. GEORGE R. SIMS's
    most moving pieces for our entertainment, often, I say, have I
    envied the simple happiness of that family, and gone back to my
    bachelor chambers with an increased sense of dissatisfaction.
    Why, I thought to myself, had fate denied to me the peaceful
    domesticity of the DABCHICKS? I was as good a man as DABCHICK,
    probably, if the truth were known, a better than he. Yet there
    he was with a good wife, an agreeable family, and a comfortable
    income to compensate him for his extravagance with the letter
    h, while I had to toil and moil in solitary gloom.</p>

    <p>Now, however, all is changed. In an evil moment for himself,
    DABCHICK speculated largely and successfully in the Gold Trust
    of Guatemala. In a very short time his income was multiplied by
    ten. The usual results followed. The happy home in Balham was
    given up. "People about here," said DABCHICK, "are such poor
    snobs"&mdash;and a more ornate mansion in South Kensington was
    taken in its stead. The old friends and the old habits were
    dropped. JOHNNY DABCHICK was sent to Eton with an immoderate
    allowance of pocket-money, and was promptly christened "PEKOE"
    by his schoolfellows. Mrs. DABCHICK rides in a huge landau with
    blue wheels, and leaves cards on the fringes of the
    aristocracy. DABCHICK himself aspires to Parliament, and never
    keeps the same circle of friends for more than about six
    months. He knows one shady Viscount to whom rumour asserts that
    he has lent immense sums of Guatemalan money, and the approach
    of a Marquis makes him palpitate with emotion. But he is a
    profoundly miserable man. Of that I am assured. It amuses me
    when I meet him in pompous society to address him lightly as
    "DAB," and remind him of the dear old Balham days, and the huge
    amount of bird's-eye we used to smoke together. For his motto
    now is, "<i>Delenda est Balhamia</i>"&mdash;I speak of course
    figuratively&mdash;and half-crown havannahs have usurped the
    place of the honest briar. I know the poor wretch is making up
    his mind to cut me, but I must bear it as best I may.</p>

    <p>Now, my dear Sir or Madam, for this melancholy deterioration
    in the DABCHICKS you are entirely responsible. I am saddened as
    I contemplate it, and I appeal to you. Scarify Dukes and
    Duchesses, make vain and useless social prigs as miserable as
    you like, but leave the DABCHICKS of this world alone. They are
    simple folk, and really I cannot think that the game is worth
    the candle.</p>

    <h2>BROADLY SPEAKING.</h2>

    <p>Advised by friend to try Norfolk Broads for holiday. Oulton
    Broad, Wroxham Broad, Fritton Decoy (curious name!), Yare,
    Waveney, and no end of other rivers. Yachting, shooting,
    fishing, pretty scenery, divine air, he says. Have come down to
    Yarmouth for a start.</p>

    <p>Up the Bure in a yacht, and into river Thurne. All right so
    far. Fish scarce. My pilot says, "wait till I get to Hickling
    Broad. <i>Full</i> of bream and roach." I agree to wait.</p>

    <p>In Hickling Broad. Surprised to find notice-boards up all
    round saying, "sailing" is prohibited in the Broad, also
    fishing and shooting! "What's the meaning of this?" I ask
    pilot. He says, "it's all the doings of the Lord of the Manor."
    Wants to keep the Broad free from tourists. He certainly does
    it "as to the Manor born." Quite a village autocrat. Shall I be
    the "Village HAMPDEN?" I will.</p>

    <p>Fishing. Several men on bank shouting at me. One comes off
    in a boat and serves me with a summons. This might almost be
    called a Broad hint to go away! But I don't go. I stop and
    fish. Another man comes off in boat and threatens me with
    action "on behalf of riparian owners." Tell him "ripe-pear-ian
    season isn't till Autumn, and I shall wait here till then." He
    doesn't see the joke&mdash;perhaps too broad for him.</p>

    <p>Other yachtsmen, we hear, have been stopped, and threatened.
    Yachtsmen up in arms generally. Savage artists wander along
    banks, denouncing Lord of Manor of Hickling. Say they have
    "right of way" along banks (sounds as if they were Railway
    Guards). Hear that Lord of Manor is going to put a gunboat on
    Broad, also torpedoes. Hear, also, that Wroxham Broad&mdash;one
    of the biggest&mdash;is to be closed in same way.</p>

    <p>Disgusted at such inhospitality. Back to Yarmouth. Give up
    yacht, and decide to go to Switzerland instead. Find Yarmouth
    yacht-owners furious with Hickling's Lord of Bad Manners. Say
    "closing the Broads will ruin them." Very likely, but it'll
    help the foreign hotel-keeper. Glad to see they've started a
    "Norfolk Broads Protection Society," subscriptions to be sent
    to Lloyd's Bank. "I know a Bank"&mdash;and all lovers of
    natural scenery and popular rights ought to know it too, and
    help in giving the Hickling obstructionist a "heckling," when
    he takes the matter (also the Manor) into Court.</p>

    <h2>A TRIPLE ALLIANCE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Scene of To-day, in a Shakspearian Setting.</i>)</h4>

    <p><i>Mr. Punch</i>. "How now, my hearts! Did you never see the
    picture of '<i>We Three</i>?'"</p>

    <p><i>Emperor</i>. Marry, forfend, <i>Mr. Punch</i>! Well
    quoted indeed, and, pertinently, from the Swan! "A mellifluous,
    voice, as I am a true Knight!" But talk not of things triune
    too openly, lest quidnuncs overhear, and L-B-CH-RE devise
    thereanent fresh heckling interrogations for the Treasury
    Bench.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Punch</i>. Nay, Kaiser; 'tis not the actual Triple,
    but the conceivable Quadruple, that perturbs the importunates.
    <i>We</i> Three form an informal but fast-knit trinity, that
    can offend none but churls, and affright none but dullards.
    Peace, Goodfellowship, Wit! By my bauble, a triad that
    PYTHAGORAS himself might have favoured! Talking of Threes,
    Kaiser, it's your third visit to us&mdash;and, believe me, you
    are thrice welcome.</p>

    <p><i>Emperor</i>. "Yea, and I thank your pretty sweet wit for
    it. But look you, pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at
    home" (as <i>Jack Falstaff</i> put it), that&mdash;you gird not
    too suspiciously at those who would fain embrace her
    abroad!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Punch</i>. Well quoted, Sir, though not directed to
    <i>mine</i> address. But "A good wit will make use of anything.
    I will turn diseases to commodity." Two diseases of the time
    are, faction and fussiness&mdash;the one a fever, the other a
    prurigo. The one makes little of greatness, the other makes
    much of littleness. You have been the mark of both, young
    Hohenzollern!</p>

    <p><i>Emperor</i>. "An't please you, it is the disease of not
    listening, the malady of not marking, that <i>I</i> am troubled
    withal."</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Punch</i>. <i>Falstaff</i> again, and pertinently
    applied. Fitly did the Fat Knight say that he was not only
    witty himself, but the cause that wit is in other men.</p>

    <p><i>Prince</i>. By cock and pye,
    <i>Poins</i>,&mdash;<i>Punch</i> I mean&mdash;am <i>I</i> to be
    out of this tournament of tags, this joust of quotations?
    Marry, not so!</p>

    <h2>HENLEY REGATTA.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own Oarsman.</i>)</h4>

    <p>Sir,&mdash;This letter is private and is not intended for
    publication. I particularly beg that you will note this, as on
    a former occasion some remarks of mine, which were intended
    only for your private eye, were printed. I of course accepted
    your assurance that no offence was meant, and that the
    oversight was due to a person whose services had since the
    occurrence been dispensed with; but I look to you to take care
    that it shall not happen again. Otherwise the mutual confidence
    that should always exist between an editor and his staff cannot
    possibly be maintained, and I shall have to transfer my
    invaluable services to some other paper. The notes and
    prognostications which I have laboriously compiled with regard
    to the final results of the Regatta will arrive by the next
    post, and will, I flatter myself, be found to be
    extraordinarily accurate, besides being written in that vivid
    and picturesque style which has made my contributions famous
    throughout the civilised world.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:20%;">
        <a href="images/21-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/21-1.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>There are one or two little matters about which I honestly
    desire to have your opinion. You know perfectly well that I was
    by no means anxious for the position of aquatic reporter. In
    vain I pointed out to you that my experience of the river was
    entirely limited to an occasional trip by steamboat from
    Charing Cross to Gravesend. You said that was an amply
    sufficient qualification, and that no aquatic reporter who
    respected himself and his readers, had ever so far degraded
    himself as to row in a boat and to place his body in any of the
    absurd positions which modern oarsmanship demands. Finding you
    were inexorable, and knowing your ridiculously hasty temper, I
    consented finally to undertake the arduous duties. These
    circumstances, however, make it essential that you should give
    me advice when I require it. For obvious reasons I don't much
    like to ask any of the rowing men here any questions. They are
    mostly in what they call hard training, which means, I fancy, a
    condition of high irritability. Their strokes may be long, but
    their tempers are, I regret to say, painfully short. Besides,
    to be candid, I don't wish to show the least trace of
    ignorance. My position demands that I should be omniscient, and
    omniscient, to all outward appearance, I shall remain.</p>

    <p>In the first place what is a "lightship?" As I travelled
    down to Henley I read in one of the newspapers that "practice
    for the Royal Regatta was now in full swing, and that the river
    was dotted with lightships of every description." I remember
    some years ago passing a very pleasant half hour on board of a
    lightship moored in the neighbourhood of Broadstairs. The rum
    was excellent. I looked forward with a lively pleasure to
    repeating the experience at Henley. As soon as I arrived,
    therefore, I put on my yachting cap (white, with a gold anchor
    embroidered in front), hired a boat and a small boy, and
    directed him to row me immediately to one of the lightships. I
    spent at least two hours on the river in company with that
    boy&mdash;a very impudent little fellow,&mdash;but owing no
    doubt to his stupidity, I failed to find a single vessel which
    could be fairly described as a lightship. Finally the boy said
    they had all been sunk in yesterday's great storm, and with
    that inadequate explanation I was forced to content myself. But
    there is a mystery about this. Please explain it.</p>

    <p>Secondly, I see placards and advertisements all over the
    place announcing that "the Stewards Stand." Now this fairly
    beats me. Why should the stewards stand? They are presumably
    men of a certain age, some of them must be of a certain
    corpulence, and it seems to me a refinement of cruelty that
    these faithful officials, of whom, I believe, the respected
    Mayor of Henley is one, should be compelled to refrain from
    seats during the whole of the Regatta. It may be necessary for
    them to set an example of true British endurance to the crowds
    who attend the Regatta, but in that case surely they ought to
    be paid for the performance of their duties.</p>

    <p>Thirdly, I have heard a good deal of talk about the
    Visitors' Cup. Being anxious to test its merits, I went to one
    of the principal hotels here, and ordered the waiter to bring
    me a quart of Visitors' Cup, and to be careful to ice it well.
    He seemed puzzled, but went away to execute my orders. After an
    absence of ten minutes he returned, and informed me, with the
    Manager's compliments, that they could not provide me with what
    I wanted, but that their Champagne-cup was excellent. I gave
    the fellow a look, and departed. Perhaps this is only another
    example of the asinine and anserous dunderheadedness of these
    crass provincials. Kindly reply, <i>by wire</i>, about all the
    three points I have mentioned.</p>

    <p>I have been here for a week, but have, as yet, not been
    fortunate enough to see any crews. Indeed, I doubt if there are
    any here. A good many maniacs disport themselves every day in
    rickety things which look something like gigantic needles, and
    other people have been riding along the bank, and, very
    naturally, abusing them loudly for their foolhardy
    recklessness. But no amount of abuse causes them to desist. I
    have puzzled my brains to know what it all means, but I confess
    I can't make it out. I fancy I know a boat when I see one, and
    of course these ridiculous affairs can't be boats.</p>

    <p>Be good enough to send me, by return, at least £100. It's a
    very difficult and expensive thing to support the dignity of
    your paper in this town. Whiskey is very dear, and a great deal
    goes a very short way.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>House, of Commons, Monday, June 29</i>.&mdash;Early
    promise of JAMES BAIN, Knight, begins to be realised. Created
    profound sensation on night he took his seat, by walking about
    with his hat on. SPEAKER down on him with swift stern reproof.
    BAIN couldn't make out what all the bother was about. Seeing a
    friend on Bench below him, thought he would go and have a chat
    with him. Members seated all about had their hats on; he had
    cautiously mounted his without reproof, and now, when he moved
    three steps with his hat on, Members howled, "Order! order!"
    and SPEAKER joined in the cry. Six or seven Members having
    explained to him that though a Member may wear his hat when
    seated, the stability of the Constitution is imperilled if he
    does not uncover when he moves, albeit a step, to the right or
    left, the new Member passed remainder of sitting in safety.</p>

             alt="Barran de Leeds." /></a>Barran de Leeds.
    </div>

    <p>Next night in his place when BARTLEY was speaking from
    corner seat below Gangway, BAIN on top Bench behind. Thought he
    would stroll out. Not going to be caught again moving about
    with his hat on. Carefully took it off, and holding it firmly
    in right hand, walked with springy steps down Gangway and,
    crossing between BARTLEY and the Chair, made for the door. As
    he emerged in full view, there went up from a hundred throats
    such a howl of indignation that BAIN stood stock still; stared
    round with look of astonishment. Were they howling at him? No
    doubt about it. SPEAKER also calling "Order! order!" in those
    thrillingly solemn tones. What had he done now? hat in his
    hand; could someone else's by any chance have got on his head?
    Passed his left hand over massive brow. No, all right. Best
    thing to do would be to get off premises as quickly as
    possible. So BAIN bolted.</p>

    <p>"My dear fellow," said BARRAN, running after him, "you know
    you mustn't do that any more. You're a young man, and I'm an
    old one. I know all the ropes in this machine. When you want
    anything ask me."</p>

    <p>"Well," said BAIN, "since you are so kind, I'd like to ask
    you what I've done now?"</p>

    <p>"Done?" cried BARRAN, "why you've crossed between a Member
    on his legs and the Chair. If you wanted to go out, you should
    have gone round by the back of the Bench."</p>

    <p>After this BAIN disappeared for some days. Getting coached
    up in Parliamentary practice. Back to-night and made maiden
    speech. Quite delightful; button-holed House as it were;
    informed Members he was sent there with a mandate; incidentally
    mentioned that he was a Magistrate in several counties; waved
    his arm in defiance of School Board and sat down, after
    declaiming, with much animation, a new and original peroration.
    "Gentlemen," he said,&mdash;"I mean Mr. SPEAKER, I'm for the
    Bill, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill."</p>

    <p>This would have been speech of the evening only for HENRY
    FOWLER's. That admirable in every way; a distinct and far
    advance on a Parliamentary position won by sheer hard work and
    ability; an epoch in a Parliamentary career already notable for
    its steady progress. Pity Mr. G. wasn't present to witness the
    triumph of the most promising of his recruits of the '80
    Parliament.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;HENRY FOWLER's Instruction to
    Education Bill negatived by 267 against 166.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;"My studies as you know, dear TOBY,
    have not specially lain in the domain of history," said
    Professor STOKES, in the course of a brief address delivered to
    me in a corner of the Library. "The pure dry light of
    mathematics has had an irresistible attraction for me.
    Possibly, therefore, I am wrong in some more or less immaterial
    points when I say that, since the time of WARWICK, we have had
    no one prominently in English public affairs with quite the
    same influence as is possessed by my Right Hon. friend JOSEPH
    CHAMBERLAIN. The time is gone by when kings were made and
    unmade. But my Right Hon. friend has done more than anyone to
    make the present Ministry possible, and, having made them, he
    claims <span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"
       id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span> the right to direct, and, in
       some respects, even to mould their policy. A very curious
       phenomenon, very curious indeed. If you were not so
       evidently in a hurry, I should like to dilate upon it."</p>

        <a href="images/24-1.png"><img width="100%"

             pure dry light of Mathematics."
    </div>

    <p>A good deal in what the Professor says; CHAMBERLAIN, as a
    rule, most considerate in his attitude. At much pains to
    preserve an appearance suitable to a Gentleman who sits on the
    Opposition Benches, and is supposed to know no more of the
    secret councils and intentions of the Ministry than anyone else
    in same quarter of House. Made a slip in earlier stages of
    Education Bill; talked about "Our Bill," and disclosed
    familiarity with its details remarkable since, at the time he
    spoke, it was not printed. Doesn't blunder twice along same
    road. Pretty to see him yesterday inviting LORD-ADVOCATE across
    the table to explain details of measure, he asked leave to
    introduce, dealing with state of things in Highlands and
    Islands of Scotland. CHAMBERLAIN being much interested in
    question, having marked it for his own, might be supposed to
    have been consulted by LORD-ADVOCATE before Bill was drafted.
    All a mistake. JOSEPH knew no more about it than an ordinary
    Member of Opposition, and would be much obliged if
    LORD-ADVOCATE would briefly sketch his Bill.</p>

    <p>To-night, on Committee on Education Bill, MUNDELLA moved
    Amendment extending beyond fourteen years limit of age at which
    fee grants would be made. DYKE obdurate. JOKIM wrung his hands,
    and protested thing couldn't be done. Hour after hour Debate
    went forward, Ministers refusing to budge; JOSEPH chanced to
    look in after dinner; thinks it would be well to accept
    Amendment; says so in brief incisive speech, a very model of
    debate; and OLD MORALITY straightway capitulates. Remarkable
    state of things; as a study more interesting even than
    mathematics.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Education Bill in Committee.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;Land Purchase Bill came on in Lords
    for Committee stage. House unusually crowded; quite animated in
    appearance; when at length it gets into Committee LORD
    CHANCELLOR leaves Woolsack and, still wearing wig and gown,
    lends new air of grace and dignity to Ministerial Bench. Sits
    between MARKISS and ASHBOURNE. Wonder what the MARKISS thinks
    of him? For a cheerful, social, soothing hour, imagine nothing
    more supreme than the confidences of the MARKISS in respect to
    some half-dozen other of his colleagues.</p>

    <p>Before Committee is reached, The MCCULLUM MORE comes to
    front, and modestly engrosses attention. Other Peers prepared,
    once in while, to buckle down to hard night's work, fighting
    over Clauses of Bill in Committee. That sort of obscure labour
    might suit them, but not the thing to attract the MCCULLUM
    MORE. Had already enjoyed himself on Second Reading, delivering
    one of those orations which, as COLCHESTER says, may be
    magnificent but are not debate. That should have satisfied
    vanity of ordinary man; but the MCCULLUM MORE not an ordinary
    man. There were several things he forgot to say in the speech.
    Others had occurred to him since. He might, without stopping
    progress of business, work them off in Committee; but in
    Committee he must needs stand on level with ordinary Peers
    anxious to get on with business, and his observations would
    probably not be reported. Thing to do was to move Instruction
    to Committee. This would bring him on first thing in a full
    House, before Peers had wearied themselves with application to
    real business. So gave notice of Instruction. Doesn't matter in
    what terms; sufficient that he was able to deliver his speech.
    MARKISS a little sarcastic in begging him <i>not</i> to press
    Instruction. Nobody showed inclination to debate it, but it had
    served its turn. Having delivered his speech, The MCCULLUM MORE
    stalked off home, leaving to others the drudgery of Committee
    work.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Land Bill through Committee in
    Lords.</p>

    <p><i>Friday Night</i>.&mdash;Education Bill through Committee.
    Last scene of all a little lively owing to revolt on
    Conservative side. RICHARD TEMPLE led it in speech of unwonted
    eloquence. Quite overflowing wealth of imagery: described
    School Board as the ogre that eats up everything; that enough
    by way of description; but TEMPLE rising to fresh heights, went
    on to characterise it as the thin edge of the wedge.</p>

    <p>Capital speech of quite another kind from JENNINGS. As the
    Member for Sark says, JENNINGS when he has anything to say to
    the House of Commons <i>talks</i>, doesn't speechify; style
    excellent, and so is the matter. House would like to hear a
    little oftener from JENNINGS; due to it from Stockport who has
    also sent us GEDGE.</p>

    <p>QUELCHING QUELCH.&mdash;Mr. QUELCH, before the Labour
    Commission, is said to have expressed his opinion that "the
    liberty to combine should not involve the liberty not to
    combine." Doesn't Mr. QUELCH see, that without "liberty not to
    combine" there <i>cannot</i> be any "liberty to combine." For
    if a man is not at liberty to abstain from combination, it is
    obvious that he is compelled to combine; and compulsion is
    hardly liberty. Freedom lies in choice, and Mr. QUELCH would
    leave the workman none.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
